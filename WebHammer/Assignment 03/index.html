    <p>Why you callin' at 11:30
        When you only wanna do me dirty?
        But I hit right back 'cause you got that, that, yeah
        Why you always wanna act like lovers
        But you never wanna be each other's?
        I say, "Don't look back" but I go right back and
        All of a sudden, I'm hypnotized
        You're the one that I can't deny
        Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away
        You turn me on like a light switch
        When you're movin' your body around and around
        Now, I don't wanna fight this (no)
        You know how to just make me want
        You turn me on like a light switch
        When you're movin' your body around and around
        You got me in a tight grip (yeah)
        You know how to just make me want you, baby
        Do you love it when you keep me guessin'? (Me guessin')
        <b><i><script>document.write('light')</script></i></b>  
        When you leave, and then you leave me stressin' (me stressin')

     <p>I've been tryna call
        I've been on my own for long enough
        Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
        I'm going through withdrawals
        You don't even have to do too much
        You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
        I look around and
        Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
        <b><i><script>document.write("Weeknd")</script></i></b>
        No one's around to judge me (oh)
        I can't see clearly when you're gone
        I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
        No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
        I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
        Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
        (Hey, hey, hey)
        I'm running out of time
        'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
        So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh</p>
